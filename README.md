# hello-world

Hello! I'm Robert H, I'm a junior in high school finishing up AP Computer Science and looking to continue in computer science in college. 
This is my portfolio of my classwork, homework, assignments, and projects. I hope you enjoy!
Besides Comp Sci, I'm a fan of chemistry, biology, and mathematics
I hike and listen to a lot of music too, especially rap and indie music.
